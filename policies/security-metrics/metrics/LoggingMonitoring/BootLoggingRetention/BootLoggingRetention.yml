description: This rule assesses whether an [VirtualMachine] has its [BootLogging][p1:retentionPeriod] property set correctly.
version: 1.0 
comments: A resource should have boot logging retention to preserve historical boot data for troubleshooting and compliance while allowing for security incident analysis. However, the retention period should not be too long to efficiently manage storage resources and minimize the risk of data leaks or unauthorized access.
