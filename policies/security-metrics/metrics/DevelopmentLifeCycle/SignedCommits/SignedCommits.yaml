comments: Signed commits are a mechanism that ensures the authenticity and integrity of code changes by attaching a cryptographic signature to each commit. This signature verifies that the commit was made by a trusted developer and has not been altered since its creation. By using signed commits, teams can enhance security and maintain a reliable history of code contributions.
