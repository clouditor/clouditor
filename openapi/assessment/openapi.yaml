                AssessEvidenceResponse belongs to AssessEvidence, which uses a custom unary
                 RPC and therefore requires a response message according to the style
                 convention. Since no return values are required, this is empty.

                         Related resource IDs. The assessment will wait until all evidences for related resource have arrived in the
                         assessment and are recent enough. In the future, this will be replaced with information in the "related" edges in
                         the resource. For now, this needs to be set manually in the evidence.

            description: 'The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).'
