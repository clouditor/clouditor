                AssessEvidenceResponse belongs to AssessEvidence, which uses a custom unary
                 RPC and therefore requires a response message according to the style
                 convention. Since no return values are required, this is empty.

            description: 'The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).'
